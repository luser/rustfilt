Demangle Rust symbol names using [rustc-demangle](https://github.com/alexcrichton/rustc-demangle). `rustfilt` works similarly to `c++filt`, in that it accepts mangled symbol names as command line arguments, and if none are provided it accepts mangled symbols from stdin. Demangled symbols are written to stdout.

## Installation
````bash
cargo install rustfilt
````

## Usage
To demangle a file, simply run:
````bash
rustfilt -i mangled.txt -o demangled.txt
````
Rustfilt can also accept data from stdin, and pipe to stdout:
````
curl example.com/mangled-symbols.txt | rustfilt | less
````

By default, rustfilt strips the generated 'hashes' from the mangled names.
If these need to be kept, simply pass the `-h` option to rustfilt.
